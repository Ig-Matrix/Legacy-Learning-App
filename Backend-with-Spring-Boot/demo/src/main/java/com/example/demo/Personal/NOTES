To handle the login functionality in Spring Boot, you'll typically need the following components:

Entities: You'll need entities to represent your users in the database. Since you have two types of users (admin and student), you might consider having a base User entity and then subclasses for AdminUser and StudentUser.

Repositories: Spring Data JPA repositories will be used to interact with the database. You'll need repositories to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your user entities.

Services: You'll need services to encapsulate the business logic for user authentication. These services will interact with the repositories to perform database operations.

Controllers: Controllers will handle incoming HTTP requests, including login requests. You'll have a login controller that receives login requests, validates the credentials, and returns an appropriate response.

Security Configuration: Spring Security will be used to handle authentication and authorization. You'll need to configure Spring Security to define the authentication mechanism and access control rules.

Here's a high-level overview of how you might implement these components:

Entities:

User: Base class for all users with common attributes like username, password, etc.
AdminUser: Subclass of User with additional attributes or permissions specific to admin users.
StudentUser: Subclass of User with additional attributes specific to student users.
Repositories:

UserRepository: Spring Data JPA repository for CRUD operations on users.
Services:

UserService: Service to handle user-related operations like authentication, account creation, etc.
Controllers:

LoginController: Controller to handle login requests. It will receive username and password, validate them, and return an authentication token or error message.
Security Configuration:

Configure Spring Security to use a custom authentication provider or user details service for authenticating users based on their username and password.
Define access control rules to restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles (admin or student).
For the admin-user functionality, you'll need additional components like admin controllers, services, and repositories to manage admin-specific operations like creating student accounts, managing permissions, etc. These components will follow a similar structure to the ones mentioned above but tailored for admin-related functionality.

Overall, by following this structure, you can create a secure and maintainable authentication system in your Spring Boot application, allowing both admin and student users to log in and access the appropriate resources based on their roles and permissions.
