Here's how you can handle consuming the announcement API on Angular for separate admin and student views:

1. Services and Dependency Injection:

Create separate services in your Angular application to handle communication with the announcement API.
AnnouncementService: Handles all announcement-related API calls (common for both views).
Inject the AnnouncementService into your components responsible for displaying announcements.


2. User Roles and Data Fetching:

Implement a mechanism to store or retrieve the user's role (admin or student) in your Angular application. This could be through user session data, JWT tokens, or a dedicated user role service.
Based on the user role, inject the appropriate data in each view component:
Admin View:
Use the AnnouncementService to fetch all announcements (including unpublished ones if needed) upon loading the view.
Implement functionalities for filtering, editing, or deleting announcements as needed.
Student View:
Use the AnnouncementService to fetch announcements relevant to the student (filtered by student groups, classes, or visibility settings).


3. Data Binding and Display:

In both views, utilize Angular data binding to display the retrieved announcements from the service.
Use components or directives to format and present the announcement data in a user-friendly way (e.g., list of announcements with titles, dates).


4. Error Handling:

Implement proper error handling in your services to catch potential errors during API calls.
Display user-friendly error messages in the views if API calls fail.
Benefits of Separation:

Separating services and logic based on user roles promotes code reusability and maintainability.
You can tailor the data fetching and display logic to the specific needs of each view.
Remember:

Adjust this approach based on your specific authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Consider using observables and asynchronous data fetching patterns for a more reactive and user-friendly experience.
