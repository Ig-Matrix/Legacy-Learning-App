Passing Feedback Data and Calculating Averages
Here's how you can handle passing feedback data and calculating averages:

1. Passing Feedback Data to Backend:

a. Data Structure:

Create a data structure in your frontend that represents a single feedback submission. This might be a JavaScript object or a class depending on your framework.
Include properties for the chosen feedback model (assessment, course, instructor), the selected response for each question (e.g., "Very Likely", "Excellent"), and any other relevant information like timestamps or user IDs.
b. Sending Data:

When the user submits the feedback form, utilize an HTTP client library in your frontend framework (like Angular's HttpClient or Axios) to send a POST request to a backend API endpoint.
The request body should be the constructed feedback data object containing all the user's selections.
c. Backend API:

Define a corresponding API endpoint on your backend to receive the POST request.
Parse the request body to access the feedback data.
Store the received feedback data in your database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) using appropriate models or tables.
2. Calculating and Displaying Averages:

a. Frontend Calculation (for quick updates):

Upon receiving multiple feedback responses, you can calculate the average ratings for each question within your frontend application.
Maintain a local data structure (e.g., an object or array) to store the current average for each question.
Whenever a new feedback response arrives, update the corresponding averages in your local data structure.
Use this local data to display the average ratings to the user.
b. Backend Calculation (for guaranteed accuracy):

For a more robust and reliable approach, you can implement average calculation logic on the backend.
When a new feedback is submitted, the backend can update the relevant database entries and recalculate the overall averages for each question.
The frontend can then fetch the updated average values from the backend using a separate API endpoint (e.g., a GET request). This ensures the displayed averages always reflect the latest data in the database.
Here's an example breakdown assuming an Angular application with a backend API:

Frontend:

User submits feedback form.
Angular application constructs a feedback data object with user selections.
The application sends a POST request to the backend API endpoint with the feedback data object in the request body.
Upon successful response, the application updates its local data structure with the newly submitted feedback (optional for immediate frontend display).
The application can also trigger a separate GET request to a different backend endpoint to fetch the latest average values from the database (recommended for accuracy).
Backend:

API endpoint receives the POST request with feedback data.
The backend parses the request body and extracts the feedback information.
It stores the feedback data in the database.
The backend updates the average ratings for each question in the database (can involve querying existing data and recalculating averages).
(Optional) The API endpoint can return a response containing the updated average values.
Frontend:

The application receives the response from the GET request containing the updated average values (if implemented in the backend).
It displays the average ratings to the user, either from the locally maintained data (if updated) or from the fetched backend data (recommended).
Additional Considerations:

Implement error handling mechanisms for both frontend and backend communication.
Consider security measures like user authentication and authorization to control access to feedback submission and viewing.
Choose an approach (frontend vs. backend) for calculating averages based on your specific requirements for performance and data consistency.
