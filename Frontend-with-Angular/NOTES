1. Layout and Components:

Divide the page into sections:
Announcement List: This section displays a list of existing announcements with details like title, date, and maybe a snippet of the content.
Announcement Details (Optional): When an announcement is selected from the list, this section displays its full details in a read-only format.
Create/Edit Announcement Form: A collapsible or modal form allows admins to create new announcements or edit existing ones.


2. List of Announcements:

Use a table or a list component to display existing announcements.
Each row/item in the list should represent an announcement and include:
Title of the announcement.
Date and time of creation (or last edit).
Optional: Shortened content snippet.
Action buttons for editing and deleting the announcement (implemented as separate components or directives).


3. Announcement Details (Optional):

This section displays the full details of a selected announcement in a read-only format.
It can include:
Title.
Full announcement content.
Date and time of creation and last edit (if applicable).
Author information (optional).


4. Create/Edit Announcement Form:

This form allows admins to enter details for new announcements or edit existing ones.
Include fields for:
Title (required).
Announcement content (rich text editor or a text area).
Optional fields like visibility settings (e.g., publish date, target groups/classes).
A submit button to save the announcement (create new or update existing).


5. Additional Considerations:

Implement clear visual cues to differentiate between announcement states (e.g., draft, published, expired).
Use validation for user input in the form (e.g., required fields, content length).
Consider implementing search and filtering functionalities for the announcement list.
Provide user-friendly confirmation dialogues for deletion actions.
Implement appropriate error handling for API calls and form submissions.


6. Technology Choices:

Use Angular Material components (or similar UI libraries) for pre-built components like tables, forms, and buttons.
Consider using a rich text editor library for editing announcement content.
Remember:

This is a general guideline, adapt it to your specific requirements and design preferences.
Ensure a user-friendly and intuitive interface for admins to manage announcements efficiently.
